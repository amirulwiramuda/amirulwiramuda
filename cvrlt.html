        <p>To HR Department</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Dear HR Department: </strong></p>
        <p>I am writing this in response to your job vacant advertised on the Internet seeking a Network Engineer. <br>
            <br>
            I had one and more year experience in Network Engineering because of my previous job as I stated on my
            Resume, and recently had a training in Cisco Networking plus I passed the CCNA Routing and Switching 200-125
            exam. <br><br>
            Working on your company would allow me to implement my skills and initiative in a professional environment
            with a valuable knowledge that I would bring to this position.<br><br>
            Please take a moment to review my attached resume. I believe I have the qualification you need and I look
            forward to hearing from you soon. <br><br><br> Sincerely, <br> <img src="ttd.png" alt="tertanda">
        </p>
        <p><strong>Amirul Wiramuda</strong></p>
